  GoModel saves you money and nerves.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Money</strong> - because you can remember the responses on this layer (caching), track your spending and do tricks like prompt compression and intelligent routing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Nerves</strong> - because we strive to achieve good quality and reliability. Our ambition is to be the last AI gateway you will need - the most reliable, resource-optimal, feature-rich and fast.
</p>

## ZES Frost Dashboard

The built-in dashboard at `/admin/dashboard` now uses the ZES Frost design: a compact, responsive workspace for configuring and operating the gateway.

- **Desktop and mobile navigation** - use the resizable desktop sidebar or the mobile menu on narrow screens. The responsive layout also makes the dashboard practical when the gateway is running locally in Termux on Android.
- **Model quick tests** - select the lightning action beside a model or virtual model to open the Playground with that model already selected.
- **Faster Playground workflow** - move directly from model configuration to a test conversation while preserving the selected model and its allowed user path.
- **Relays & Bridges** - create, inspect, edit, and remove stable model aliases from a dedicated page. A relay can point a public model name at one or more provider targets for fallback or balancing.

The rebrand does not change the gateway's command-line contract. Existing `gomodel` executables, `.env` files, `config.yaml` files, API routes, and integrations remain compatible.

## Quick Start

**Step 1:** Install and start the gateway

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/install.sh | sh
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key" # (optional)
gomodel
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/install.ps1 | iex
# $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-key" # (optional)
gomodel
```

**Docker**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key" \
  enterpilot/gomodel
```

ℹ️ Configure ZES Gateway with `.env`, a `config.yaml` file, or manage the most important settings directly in the dashboard. The executable remains `gomodel`.

ℹ️ See [`.env.template`](./.env.template) for the complete list of environment variables, including all available providers.

**Step 2:** Open the dashboard

```text
http://localhost:8080/admin/dashboard
```

**Step 3:** Make an API call

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5-chat-latest",
    "input": "Hello!"
  }'
```

## GoModel and official SDKs

GoModel accepts requests in two compatible formats:

- OpenAI-compatible at `/v1`
- Anthropic-compatible at `/v1/messages`

The official SDKs therefore work unchanged. Configure their base URLs as follows:

- OpenAI SDK: `http://localhost:8080/v1`
- Anthropic SDK: `http://localhost:8080` (the SDK appends `/v1/messages`)

## Docker Compose

**Infrastructure only** (Redis, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Adminer - no image build):

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Add your API keys to .env
docker compose up -d
# or: make infra
```

**Full stack** (adds GoModel + Prometheus; builds the app image):

```bash
docker compose --profile app up -d
# or: make image
```

## Gateway Configuration

GoModel resolves configuration in the following order, with each source
overriding those to its left:

[Good defaults](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/about/technical-philosophy#good-defaults) → [`config.yaml`](./config/config.example.yaml) → [`.env`](./.env.template) → exported environment variables

See the [Configuration reference](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/configuration?utm_source=readme)
for the full list of settings.

## Features

- [Caching](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/cache?utm_source=readme) - exact and semantic response caching, so repeated prompts cost nothing
- [Cost tracking](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/cost-tracking?utm_source=readme) - per-request cost estimates, usage analytics, and spending breakdowns in the dashboard
- [Budgets](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/budgets?utm_source=readme) - hard spend limits per user, team, or key
- [Rate limits](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/rate-limits?utm_source=readme) - requests, tokens, and concurrency caps per user path, provider, or model
- [Usage API](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/usage-api?utm_source=readme) - clients check their own usage, remaining budget, and rate-limit headroom with the key they already use for inference
- [Virtual models](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/virtual-models?utm_source=readme) - aliases and load balancing (round-robin or cost-based) behind stable model names
- [Session keeping](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/session-keeping?utm_source=readme) - detect a client session and pin it to one target and provider key, so provider prompt caches stay warm and audit logs read as threads
- [Failover](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/failover?utm_source=readme) - automatic rerouting to backup providers, with [retries and circuit breakers](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/resilience?utm_source=readme)
- [Labelling](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/labelling?utm_source=readme) - tag requests from HTTP headers or API keys and break down usage by label
- [User paths](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/user-path?utm_source=readme) - hierarchical scoping of keys, model access, budgets, usage, and audit logs
- [Model access control](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/users?utm_source=readme) - per-group, per-user, and per-key model allowlists that intersect down the user-path tree
- [MCP gateway](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/mcp-gateway?utm_source=readme) - aggregate your MCP servers behind one authenticated endpoint
- [Passthrough API](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/passthrough-api?utm_source=readme) - provider-native APIs under `/p/{provider}/...`, with GoModel auth and tracking
- [Audio and image APIs](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/audio-api?utm_source=readme) - OpenAI-compatible text-to-speech, transcription, and [image generation and editing](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/images-api?utm_source=readme) with the same access rules, budgets, and cost tracking as chat
- [Provider replay state](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/extra-content?utm_source=readme) - preserves Gemini thought signatures and Anthropic thinking blocks across turns, APIs, and providers
- [Guardrails](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/guardrails?utm_source=readme) - request and response policies enforced at the gateway
- [Plugins](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/plugins?utm_source=readme) - one contract for guardrails, response and stream filters, header edits, and routing strategies; built in, compiled in, or loaded from a `.so` at startup
- [Workflows](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/advanced/workflows?utm_source=readme) - versioned per-request policies that scope cache, budgets, audit logging, guardrail phases, and failover by user path, provider, or model
- [Provider key rotation](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/providers/key-rotation?utm_source=readme) - round-robin over multiple API keys to lift per-key rate limits
- [Observability](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/guides/prometheus-metrics?utm_source=readme) - Prometheus metrics, [OpenTelemetry](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/guides/opentelemetry?utm_source=readme) traces, audit logs, and live request streaming in the dashboard
- [Playground](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/features/playground?utm_source=readme) - try any model or virtual model from the dashboard and inspect the exact request and response JSON

## GoModel Pro

[GoModel Pro](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/pro/overview?utm_source=readme) is the commercial build: the same gateway, configuration, and dashboard, with licensed extensions.

- [Prompt compression](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/pro/compression?utm_source=readme) - remove repeated and structural context before it reaches the provider, without changing the request shape
- [Intelligent routing](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/pro/intelligent-routing?utm_source=readme) - classify each request as easy or hard, then pick the healthiest and cheapest provider in that tier
- [OIDC single sign-on](https://gomodel.enterpilot.io/docs/pro/sso?utm_source=readme) - protect the dashboard with your identity provider using Authorization Code flow with PKCE
